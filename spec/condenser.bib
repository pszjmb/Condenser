  abstract = {In the past few years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been gaining
	increasing attention because of their potential of enabling of novel
	and attractive solutions in areas such as industrial automation,
	environmental monitoring, transportation business, health-care etc.
	If we add this collection of sensor derived data to various Web-based
	social networks or virtual communities, blogs etc., we can have a
	remarkable transformation in our ability to ``see'' ourselves and
	our planet. Our primary goal is to facilitate connecting sensors,
	people and software objects to build community-centric sensing applications.
	However, the computational tools needed to launch this exploration
	may be more appropriately built from the data center ``Cloud'' computing
	model than the traditional HPC approaches. In this paper, we propose
	a framework to enable this exploration by integrating sensor networks
	to the emerging data center ``cloud'' model of computing. But there
	are many challenges to enable this framework. We propose a pub-sub
	based model which simplifies the integration of sensor networks with
	cloud based communitycentric applications. Also there is a need for
	internetworking cloud providers in case of violation of service level
	agreement with users. We discussed these issues and proposed reasonable
	solutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract—The field of wireless sensor networks has produced a range
	of supporting hardware and software technologies that
	
	 facilitate the creation of sensor network applications. Despite these
	advances, the implementation of wireless sensor network applications
	remains a complex task that requires domain experts and a significant
	investment of time and money. This level of investment is often infeasible
	for single applications, especially for those applications with a
	short life-cycle. This paper suggests a new direction in wireless
	sensor network research. We argue that next generation sensor network
	platforms should strive towards a shared infrastructure, multiapplication
	paradigm, with a clean separation of concerns between infrastructure
	providers and application developers. These are principles that are
	well established in the field of Cloud Computing. This paper introduces
	our vision for future sensor networks, which we refer to as the ‘Tangible
	Cloud’. To support this vision, we introduce a reference architecture
	and pricing model for sensor network resources.},

  abstract = {The recent popularity of sensor networks and cloud computing has brought
	new opportunities of sensor-cloud integration that facilitates users
	to immediately forecast the future status of what they are observing.
	The main challenge is how to establish a series of elastic data channels
	from sensors to mobile users through data-analyzing jobs running
	in the cloud. The variation of network protocols, the dynamism of
	cloud-computing resources, and even user mobility result in the following
	three design problems. Data-analyzing programs must: (1) deal with
	the major sensor and cloud communication protocols; (2) include hard-coded
	sensor manipulation and data retrieval operations; and (3) handle
	job/user migration in dynamic cloud environments, which needs the
	recovery of broken data connections. To address these problems, we
	are developing the Connector software tool kit that provides cloud
	jobs with uniform data channels, allows them to exchange standard
	input/output as well as graphics with remote users, and re-establishes
	their data channels upon a job or user migration. This paper presents
	Connector’s system overview, implementation, and performance consideration.},
