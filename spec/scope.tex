	\section{Scope}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) identifies the requirements for the Condenser Data Logging Platform.
		\subsection{Problem Statement}
A trend across various Horizon projects (Energy and Relate for instance) is to provide distributed (immutable) sensor data capture, process and storage facilities. The connection between the local environment and external control and storage environment, however, is intermittent and unreliable.  This disconnection results in many disadvantages such as data loss. Horizon projects have heretofore provided bespoke solutions to the external connections, however these have become difficult to maintain with the increase of projects.		
		\subsection{Objectives}
The aim of the Condenser (meta)-project is to provide a configurable component for local logging of immutable data to a local server with intermittent synchronisation to external (possibly cloud-based) storage environments. The Condenser component will be made widely available and be data-type neutral.
		\subsection{Document Overview}
Section 2 is divided into functional requirements and the non-functional requirements. The functional requirements explain the interactions between Condenser and its environment (including usage scenarios and cases). The non-functional requirements explain the quality constraints. Section 3 provides critical review of state-of-the-art existing options and existing components that may be leveraged in the delivery of Condenser.
