Cloud Storage Synchronization Literature Search

Provenance
	JMB
	Nov. 2011
	Scope: 
		- Interested in determining current solutions for storing sensor data in the Cloud
		- required understanding of:
			* general cloud computing ideas and terminology
			* specific connections between Cloud Computing & Sensors
			* cloud (and general file/data) synchronization options
			* database replication
			* Weak n/w connection handling
		- During search expanded notion from simple synchronization at source to cloud gateway

	Methods:
			Google scholar
			Wikipedia
			Paper references
			alternativeto
			ieee
			acm

Outcomes			
	Cloud Computing & Sensor Data
		- Most resources are orientated at the Cloud-level (that is to tsay the back-end data centres) rather than the data input level
		- "Capacities continue to double each year, while access times are improving at 10 percent per year." - Jim Grey http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=864078
		- The Big 4 (Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Rackspace) offer various storage models
		- According to http://www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk/: 31.21 Mb/s download (337068 MB/d ), 13.29 Mb/s upload (143532 MB/d) here at Horizon
		General resources
			Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing
				- Definitions: 	* cloud = Datacentre h/w + s/w
								* SaaS = Services run on top of datacentre
				- Opportunities:	* The cloud will become dominant because it is the most convinient way to store automated (large) datasets from sensors and users -- services can then process, analyse and mashup the highly available data 
									* infinite capacity on-demand
				- Obstacles:	* Service availability
								* Data lock-in -- possibly mitigated by API standardization
								* Data confidentiality -- mitigated by encryption prior to storage
								* Data transfer bottlenecks -- costs ($100-$150 / TB -- unclear where figure comes from; )
																- SneakerNet is probably not viable here [Automated SneakerNet for smart buildings???]
			
			Cloud Storage: Adoption, Practice and Deployment
				- Definitions: 	* cloud computing = WAN infrastructure
								* Cloud (with a capital C) = the public data network including the Internet
				- Provides a good overview of various issues such as security and data verification, performance, inter-cloud portability
				- Block Systems, File Systems (CIFS, NFS and GFS) and Object Storage

	Cloud Storage Gateway
		General resources
			CloudStorageSurvey_Avere
				- make cloud storage appear as local storage
				- translates cloud storage APIs to file interfaces or storage transport protocols
				- gateway resides at customer site
					- can be dedicated appliance/server, virtual appliance/server, or s/w application
						- features: compression, deduplication, encryption, caching, backup & recovery
				- Provides useful table columns for comparing cloud grteways, but unfortunately the table is incomplete (only the Avere FXT was examined and these cost \$50000+)
