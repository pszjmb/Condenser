	Nov. 2011
	Scope: 
		- Interested in determining current solutions for storing sensor data in the Cloud
		- required understanding of:
			* general cloud computing ideas and terminology
			* specific connections between Cloud Computing & Sensors
			* cloud (and general file/data) synchronization options
			* database replication
			* Weak n/w connection handling
		- During search expanded notion from simple synchronization at source to cloud gateway

Outcomes			
	Cloud Computing & Sensor Data
		- Most resources are orientated at the Cloud-level (that is to tsay the back-end data centres) rather than the data input level
		- "Capacities continue to double each year, while access times are improving at 10 percent per year." - Jim Grey http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=864078
		- The Big 4 (Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Rackspace) offer various storage models
		- According to http://www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk/: 31.21 Mb/s download (337068 MB/d ), 13.29 Mb/s upload (143532 MB/d) here at Horizon
		General resources
			Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing
				- Definitions: 	* cloud = Datacentre h/w + s/w
								* SaaS = Services run on top of datacentre
				- Opportunities:	* The cloud will become dominant because it is the most convinient way to store automated (large) datasets from sensors and users -- services can then process, analyse and mashup the highly available data 
									* infinite capacity on-demand
				- Obstacles:	* Service availability
								* Data lock-in -- possibly mitigated by API standardization
								* Data confidentiality -- mitigated by encryption prior to storage
								* Data transfer bottlenecks -- costs (\$100-\$150 / TB -- unclear where figure comes from; )
																- SneakerNet is probably not viable here [Automated SneakerNet for smart buildings???]
			
			Cloud Storage: Adoption, Practice and Deployment
				- Definitions: 	* cloud computing = WAN infrastructure
								* Cloud (with a capital C) = the public data network including the Internet
				- Provides a good overview of various issues such as security and data verification, performance, inter-cloud portability
				- Block Systems, File Systems (CIFS, NFS and GFS) and Object Storage				

		Sensor-Cloud
			Can We Plug Wireless Sensor Network to Cloud?
				- Raw data vs events
					simple or complex events
				- Proposed platform architecture (unclear where platform components live)
					[Of interest to this work (other componenets are downstream to sync data)]
					* WSN virtualiseation manager
						- adapter provides raw byte stream from WSN to gateway which gateway enques as a raw packet in a buffer
						- Data processors affect enqueued packets
						- Command interpreter reprograms sensors via the gateway
					* Computation and storage manager
						- Processes and archives sensor data as XML
			% System Architecture Directions for Tangible Cloud Computing
				% - Excluded on the basis of not solving sync problem
			A framework of sensor-cloud integration opportunities and challenges
				- Goal: connect sensors, people and s/w to build community-centric sensing applications
				- "current Cloud providers did not address the issue of integrating sensor network with Cloud applications and thus have no infrastructure to support this scenario"
				- Cloud vs grid (and how cloud is more appropriate for WSN data, but wsn-cloud integration is an unaddressed issue )
				- Proposed solution
					- Sensors stream data to gateway
					- Gateway sends data to pub-sub system in the cloud
					- Cloud services provide event monitoring and application services
			A design of flexible data channels for sensor-cloud integration
				- Attempts to integrate data channels from sensors to data analysis jobs in cloud
				- Their tools include Sensor Server
					- Runs on SN master node
					- activate/deactivate slave nodes
					- filter sn data
					- deliver data to clouds
					- Acts as a pull-based FTP server that makes sensors accessible to cloud services as files
				- Comms models
					- Push based
						* 1 data point = UDP packet or SNMP packet
					- Pull based				
			WhereStore: location-based data storage for mobile devices interacting with the cloud
				%- [A lot of the paper would be useful when considering predicitve storage patterns, however notes about their location prediction have been excluded from this lit revie]
					% - "Predicting an application's data pattern is one problem, deciding the exact time at which data should be fetched from the cloud is yet another." 
					% - "a system like WhereStore can use information about current and future Internet access opportunities as well as information about dierent access technologies (e.g. 3G or WiFi) to make decisions about when to communicate with a remote cloud storage service. An intelligent decision may reduce the total power consumption of the device without data access penalties"
				- Filtered replication
					- keep data synced b/w set of peers
						- collections of items (each item containing data and metadata)
						- replicas of entire collections or subsets
						- filters (predicates over metadata) describe subsets
				- architecture
					- phone client, cloud server
					- WhereStore is stacked on top of:
						-filtered replication system
							- sync local cache on phone with cloud data items
							- smartphone replica contains items defined by its filter
								- subset of items for which totla capacity is below specified storage capacity
								- selection algorithm is given in paper
							- Based on Cimbiosys
								- Data accessed through callbacks
						-location service

	Cloud Storage Gateway
		General resources
			CloudStorageSurvey_Avere
				- make cloud storage appear as local storage
				- translates cloud storage APIs to file interfaces or storage transport protocols
				- gateway resides at customer site
					- can be dedicated appliance/server, virtual appliance/server, or s/w application
						- features: compression, deduplication, encryption, caching, backup & recovery
				- Provides useful table columns for comparing cloud grteways, but unfortunately the table is incomplete (only the Avere FXT was examined and these cost $50000+)
